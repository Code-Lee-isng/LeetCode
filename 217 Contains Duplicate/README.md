# Thoughts

# Method 1, Brute Force

T, O(n^2), S, O(1)

# Method 2, HashSet, 

T, O(n), S, O(n)

Several ways to use, hs.contains(); hs.add(); hs.size() == array.length;

# Method 3, HashMap

T, O(N), S, O(N),

Same as HashSet,

# Method 4, Sortion,

T, O(nlgn), S, O(n)

Sort array first, then if it contains duplicate elements, then they are adjacent to each other

# Method 5, 

Still dont understand now....




# Method 6, boolean array

T, O(n), S, O(1)

//0 ms, 100%

See explanation in solutions, some examples may not work for this solution.
