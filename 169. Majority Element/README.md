# Method 1, Brute Force

T, O(n^2), S, O(1)

Nested Loop, count duplicated times of every element.

# Method 2, HashMap

T, O(n), S, O(n)

For loop, search every element, check if it's contained in HashMap. If not, store it and duplicated times : 1; otherwise, increasing duplicated times by 1. 

# Sort, return nums(n/2)
