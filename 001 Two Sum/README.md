Most easy way is nesting for loop, easy to understand,

1. variables, like i & j, put it inside of for loop; at the end, memory will be released
2. an effective way to return an array, return new int [] {a, b, c...};
3. before any algorithm, it's better to check whether parameters passed are legal or not,


# Optimization

for nested for loop, time complexity is O(n^2), space complexity is O(1)

However, HashMap is a better way. TC could be O(N),
