Simple way(solution1), check if there is profit buy it today and sell it tomorrow. If so, do the transaction. If not, continue next day.

If there is another limitation: You can't sell it and buy it again at the same day. 
So, you have to find the min, and after the min find the max, then do the transaction.(solution2)
