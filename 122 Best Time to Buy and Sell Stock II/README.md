# Tips

Simple way(solution1), check if there has profit with buying it today and selling it tomorrow. If so, do the transaction. If not, continue next day. (n-1 times transaction)

If there is another limitation: You can't sell it and buy it again at the same day. 
So, you have to find the min(valley), and after the min find the max(peak), then do the transaction.(solution2)
